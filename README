What this does:
    This scripts the BSD installation:
    1. ZFS pool configuration
    2. GELI password
    3. system configuration
        packages
        files
        chmod / chown
        boot-loader
        rc.conf
        sysctl
        groups
        users
        scripts (run)
    4. updates the system using freebsd-update fetch install

Requirements
    1. network connectivity
    2. git repository with system configuration (example to be posted)

Why
    Everything I do *MUST* be repeatable and I strive to not repeat myself.
    Every knob can be traced to a "patch" and a reason why.
    I can have a fully-configured, operational system quickly.

Why not Boot Environments (BEs)?
    BEs are a supplement and in fact I use BEs alongside this to rollback in the even of a failure that I cannot easily move forward


Instructions:
1. install "install" utility
    git clone install ...
    cd install
    cp app-* /usr/local/sbin (or wherever your root dir is)
    app-install

2. download and install FreeBSD onto a USB drive
    dd ...

3. mount USB drive @ /mnt/usb

4. get freebsd-installer
    git clone freebsd-installer

5. install freebsd-installer to USB
    cd freebsd-installer
    ROOT=/mnt/usb app-install
    umount /mnt/usb

6. boot to USB

7. invoke bsdinstall-boostrap
    /usr/local/bin/bsdinstall-bootstrap
        net, dev, dev_name, hostname, git, branch, geli_password
